## Signal Detection and Classification Model
#FINAL PROJECT FOR DEEP LEARNING ASIGNMENT 

This repository contains a deep learning model from the pretrained architecture YOLO, for signal detection and classification. 

The model is capable of processing input data and determining the presence of a signal in the data, as well as classifying it into one of several predefined categories.

[IMPORTANT] To make the model work -> it is needed to clone yolov5 github repository.
