# Signal Detection and Classification Model
 This repository contains a deep learning model from the pretrained architecture YOLO, for signal detection and classification. The model is capable of processing input data and determining the presence of a signal in the data, as well as classifying it into one of several predefined categories.

## IMPORTANT
 To make the model work -> it is needed to clone yolov5 github repository.
